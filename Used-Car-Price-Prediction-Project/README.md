# Project 4: Used Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project involves building a model to predict used car prices based on technical specifications and other features.

## Objective
Develop a model that accurately predicts used car prices while considering prediction quality, speed, and training time.

## Key Steps
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation using RMSE metric
- Hyperparameter tuning for CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, and Linear Regression models

## Models Used
- CatBoost
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- Random Forest
- Linear Regression

## Findings
- **CatBoost**: RMSE = 1867.59, train time = 2.37s (best performer).
- **LightGBM**: RMSE = 1943.41, train time = 310.12s.
- **Linear Regression**: RMSE = 3216.39, train time = 22.45s.
