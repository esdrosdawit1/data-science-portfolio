# Project 1: Age Detection using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project involves building a model to detect a person's age from images using computer vision techniques.

## Objective
Develop a model that accurately predicts age from images to help supermarkets adhere to alcohol laws.

## Key Steps
- Data exploration and analysis
- Model training and evaluation using a neural network
- Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization

## Models Used
- Neural Network (CNN)

## Findings
The model showed promising results in age detection, which can be further improved with additional data and tuning.

## Code
Code: [Age Detection using Computer Vision.ipynb](./Age-Verfication-For-Alcohol-Sales-Project.ipynb)

## Data
The dataset contains images with age labels. Due to data privacy restrictions, the dataset is not publicly available.
