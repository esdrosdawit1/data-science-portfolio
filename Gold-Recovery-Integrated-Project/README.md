# Project 2: Gold Recovery Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict gold recovery from gold ore using machine learning models.

## Objective
Develop a model to predict gold recovery and evaluate its performance.

## Key Steps
- Data preparation and analysis
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation using cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning and model selection

## Models Used
- Random Forest
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree

## Findings
Random Forest performed best with a final sMAPE of 8.58 (validation) and 12.10 (test set). Other models: Linear Regression (sMAPE = 13.18), Decision Tree (sMAPE = 12.86).

## Data
The gold recovery dataset contains industrial process measurements. Due to data privacy restrictions, the dataset is not publicly available.
